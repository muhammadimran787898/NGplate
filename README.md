# [Next.js Enterprise Boilerplate]

A production-ready template for building enterprise applications with Next.js. This boilerplate provides a solid foundation with carefully selected technologies and ready-to-go infrastructure to help you develop high-quality applications efficiently.

## Motivation

While most Next.js boilerplates focus on individual developer needs with excessive complexity, **next-enterprise** prioritizes strategic simplicity for enterprise teams. It offers a streamlined foundation with high-impact features that maximize developer productivity and accelerate time-to-market for business-critical applications.



> [!NOTE]
> **Blazity** is a group of Next.js architects. We help organizations architect, optimize, and deploy high-performance Next.js applications at scale if you’d like to talk about your project.



## Documentation

There is a separate documentation that explains its functionality, highlights core business values and technical decisions, provides guidelines for future development, and includes architectural diagrams.
